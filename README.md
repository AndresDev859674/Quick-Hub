## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This script has immense potential. However, please be aware that it's not designed for simply enhancing gameplay for fun. It includes scripts like aimbots, ESP (Extra Sensory Perception), walk speed, and fly hacks, which can lead to getting banned in games like *Roblox RIVALS*.

**Caution:** You should only use it in games that are not well-protected, like *Prison Life*, a chaotic hacker-friendly game. Always use at your own risk!

## üëÄ Announcement

Quick Scripts Hub's **Basic Tab** will no longer support player behaviors. These will now be managed through the **Quick Functions Hub**, a new platform dedicated to player modification scripts! Our goal is to introduce mechanisms that allow you to modify your player without getting banned or kicked from the game.

Additionally, **Quick Scripts Hub** is now rebranded as **Quick Hub**!! Stay tuned for more updates and features.

## ü§î What Is Quick Hub?

**Quick Hub** is a simple tool designed to help you run scripts through **Quick Scripts Hub** and access player functions via **Quick Functions Hub** on Roblox without needing to search the web. While updates may be slow and there isn't yet a massive collection of the latest scripts, **Quick Hub** still has huge potential. 

It‚Äôs important to note that these scripts are not designed to enhance the game but rather to modify, break, or even destroy it. They can also lead to bans. Additionally, it's unclear whether you can implement certain features using Lua on servers like scriptblox.com, but the possibilities remain vast.

If you'd like to suggest a new script, feel free to submit it via the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/AndresDev859674/Quick-Hub/issues) and tag it with the "enhancement" label.

## ‚ùì Why Do Some Scripts Not Appear in the Menu?

If you're not seeing some scripts, it could be due to the game's resource load, which might depend on the capabilities of your PC or phone.
