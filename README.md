## What Is Quick Scripts Hub? ü§î

Quick Scripts Hub is a quick script picker that lets you select and run scripts without needing to search the browser. However, updates are quite slow to come out. Quick Scripts Hub has immense potential (with strong Roblox scripts) that can either enhance or destroy the game, or even get you banned. Note that these are not game-improving scripts; they are scripts that can potentially disrupt the game. You can visit the [GitHub page](https://github.com/AndresDev859674/Quick-Scripts-Hub-V2) to report bugs or request scripts from the creator through the Issues tab.
